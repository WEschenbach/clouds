This GitHub Repository contains all of the files and R language programs necessary to duplicate the images and analyses in the paper "Observational and theoretical evidence that cloud feedback decreases warming". The main program is entitled "Cloud Feedback Final.R". Place all of the files in a folder on your computer, and change your R workspace to that folder. Then you will be able to run the main program.If you have problems with the code, please email me at weschenbach @t gmail.com (address munged to foil bots).Best regards,Willis Eschenbach
